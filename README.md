# Java Snake Game

## Project Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Java and Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows the player to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the edges of the game board.

## Features

- **Simple Controls:** Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- **Food Generation:** The game randomly generates food that the snake must eat to grow.
- **Increasing Difficulty:** As the snake eats more food, it grows longer and the game speed increases.
- **Game Over Logic:** The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Scoring:** The playerâ€™s score is determined by the number of food items consumed.

## Installation
